Hi there and welcome to my github!

I'm going to be making a feed forward neural network that uses momentum and hopefully some other neat tricks to to eventually recognize and categorize the basic digits (0 to 9).

This readme will have instructions on how exactly to use it as soon as I've figured that all out. For now it's very much still a work in progress!
